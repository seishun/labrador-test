Please write a function in node.js (ES 6+) which will parse the pdfs inside the zip file and will extract the MPAN from the docs.
What is an MPAN? Check the Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_Point_Administration_Number page, it should be easy to identify it in the docs. In the UK there are more than 70 energy providers and they all have a different bill format, however, the MPAN section is pretty much similar. 
Don't spend too much time on this, a couple of hours, we'd like to see how the problem is approached, which libraries are used, suggest next steps in a readme, how would you ensure that your algorithm would cover the whole market, how would you approach this little project? 

We hope you'll enjoy coding and look forward to reviewing the solution. 
Please do not hesitate to ask us any questions.
